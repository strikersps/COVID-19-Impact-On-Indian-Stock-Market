    "# Impact of COVID-19 on Indian Economy from the Perspective of Indian Stock Market\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name: Suraj Prakash Sharma**  \n",
    "**Registeration Number: BLENP2DSC20038**  \n",
    "**Batch: M.Tech Data Science (2020-2022)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "* **This project is an analysis based on the publicly available datasets related to COVID-19, Indian Stock Market Price Action Dataset, Volatility Prices and Oil Prices. The goal is to examine the behaviour of Indian Stock Market from Jan 2020 to Dec 2020 and how it was impacted due to COVID-19, Oil Price War between Russia and Saudi Arabia, Lockdowns due to COVID-19 and other major events happened during the period.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Indian stock market saw one of the biggest falls in its history i.e. **BSE SENSEX and NIFTY-50 corrected sharply by 38% in March 2020**, more specifically this crash was another major crash after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 which was due to fall in the Housing Price in the USA.\n",
    "* COVID-19 had a brutal and dramatic impact on financial markets all over the world. It has exposed investors to unprecedented levels of risks causing investors all over the world to suffer significant losses in a very short period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The idea was that if you want to measure/gauge the behaviour of the stock market then you look at the different indices listed in the exchanges as indices are the best way to measure how the whole market or a section/sector of the market is performing. Market indices are classified on the basis of broader/benchmark market indices and sector indices majorly and every exchange has its own set of indices.\n",
    "* Indian Stock Market has two major exchanges namely National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange and there are more than 5000 companies listed on both the exchanges and monitored by the market regulator SEBI. So to gauge the market we need to look at the price action of benchmark indices and sector indices. There are various indices but the most famous and concise indices are SENSEX of Bombay Stock Exchange(BSE) and NIFTY-50 of National Stock Exchange(NSE). There is another index known as INDIA VIX which is a way to gauge the volatility in the Indian market. Volatility is a very important parameter in order to understand whether on a given market session or time period the investors are afraid or greedy when doing trading in the market.  \n",
    "* The stock market in the short term can be considered as a sentiment index of an economy and it's a way to measure the emotions of an economy. If you look at the stock market benchmark indices after March 2020, you will see a very quick recovery in the market and selected sectors like IT, Pharmaceuticals due to which it is hard to answer the question whether COVID-19 has impacted the market or not just on the basis of data?  \n",
    "* The main goal of the project is to identify/quantify the relationship between the COVID-19 and other major events which are a direct or indirect consequence of COVID-19 and its impact on the Indian Economy by studying, visualising, and establishing relationships between the Indian Stock Market Indices (NIFTY-50 and SENSEX), COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world, lockdowns imposed by the governments and various other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This report stays away from making prediction on Indian financial markets because a huge proportion of Indian economy is unorganized. With limited time and infrastructure, it is really hard to make any short term predictions of the stock market because upside and downside in a short term or long term depends upon various factors like economic, social, technology, climate, businesess etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to \"beat the market\" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information. The idea that financial market returns are difficult to predict goes back to [Bachelier (1900)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis#cite_note-3), [Mandelbrot (1963)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot), and [Samuelson (1965)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Samuelson), but is closely associated with [Eugene Fama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Fama), in part due to his influential 1970 review of the theoretical and empirical research.**"

    "### Importing The Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "* First we are importing all the important libraries which are required for the project.\n",
    "* Some of the libraries are pretty common when it comes to Data Analysis in Python like `numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn`.\n",
    "* For this project we needed some additional libraries in order to extract the data from 3rd party services in order to generate insights whose information is as follows:\n",
    "    * `Quandl`: Its one of the most used libraries which provides data about different tradable securities in the stock market given that those data must be available to the non-premium users. I have used this libraries in order to extract the data about two commodities and one benchmark index as these three securities (**Brent Crude Oil, WTI Crude Oil, SENSEX**) were highly affected by COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `pytrends`: Its one of the libraries which is used in order to extract the Google Trends data through which we can gauge the sentiment of the users when they use Google Search. The data is provided by Google and this library you can think of as a wrapper aroung the Google Trends API.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For doing the visualisation I have heavily used `Plotly` because it provides interactive maps which is important from the project perpective and whenever I needed to do any statistical measures I have used seaborn beacause this library is mostly known for doing statistical analysis of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NOTE**: For using `Quandl`, I needed a API key in order to send the request to their servers thats why there is a small piece of code in the following cell where I am reading the data from a text file which is API key provided to me for security reasons."

The numbers are concerning because even after around 70 days of lockdown and other steps taken by government, the graph seems to be climbing up rapidly.\n",

    "    1. **Market was reacting in anticipation and the effect of Globalization.** The market downturn was influenced by a non-economic factor and it has affected almost all of the sectors of the economy. But one more question arises at the same time that how come only one event i.e. COVID-19 pandemic has made the market fall by that much, more clearly **Does COVID-19 is the only reason for the fall happened?** and the answer is Yes but not just COVID-19 rather the sequence of events caused by COVID-19 like countries imposing strict lockdown policies, businesses are shutting down their daily operations except the pharmaceutical and consumer discretionary sectors, MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) are severely affected due to lockdowns, people all around the world were panicking (which is not good) under the impression of Global Recession and at the same time there was a war on Oil Prices which had happened between Saudi-Arabia and Russia which made the market fall further in March and April of 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. COVID-19 is still there and it is affecting people at a pace but markets all around the world are at all time highs just after the fall of March, 2020 which is a contradiction to my initial hyphothesis that even though COVID-19 has made the market fall sharply, then how come the markets recovered so quickly in just 8-9 months?"
